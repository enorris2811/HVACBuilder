<p><strong>Run Conditions</strong>:<br> The unit will supply conditioned air to its designated zone or linked air
    terminals
    and operates a constant volume air unit. The unit will run acccording to the following user selectable modes:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Off</li>
    <li> Continuously</li>
    <li> via BAS Command</li>
    <li> as Locally Scheduled</li>
    <li> via Link Schedule</li>
</ul><br> <br>
<p><strong>Off Mode</strong>:<br> The unit will run and all dampers, valves and fans will remain in their off
    position.<br> <br><strong>Continuously</strong>: <br>The unit will run continuously in the occupied mode.<br><br>
    <strong> via BAS Command</strong>:<br><br> The unit will be enabled and disabled via a Bacnet Binary Command, either
    from a remote source or locally through the software interface. Once enabled the unit will run continuously in the
    occupied mode. <br><br><strong> as Locally Scheduled</strong>:<br> The air handling unit will operate as a constant
    volume unit having setpoints that represent those of a single zone unit. The unit will then run according to a user
    finable time schdule in the follow modes: <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Occupied Mode:</strong>the unit will maintain A <input type=\'text\' id=\'occHighSetpoint\'> degrees
            F space cooling setpoint. </li>
        <li> A <input type=\'text\' id=\'occLowSetpoint\'> degrees F space heating set point.</li>
        <li> Unoccupied Mode (night setback): The unit will maintain A <input type=\'text\' id=\'unOccHighSetpoint\'>
            degrees F space cooling setpoint. </li>
        <li> A <input type=\'text\' id=\'unOccLowSetpoint\'> degress F space heating setpoint.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <strong>via Linked Scheduled:</strong> the air handling unit will exchange information with the terminal
    units as follows: <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculated information sent from the Air Handling Unit to the Terminal Units:</li>
        <li>Current Mode of operation</li>
        <li>Current supply air temperatur</li>
        <li>Current outside Air Temperature</li>
    </ul><br><br>Caluculated information representative of all terminal units sent from the terminal units to the air
    handling unit:<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Space Temperature</li>
        <li>Setpoints, both occupied and unoocupied</li>
        <li>Maximum Damper Position</li>
        <li>Indoor air quality</li>
        <li>Space relative humidity (if present)</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p>Based off the above information exchange, the air handling unit will determine which operation best meets
        the needs of the terminal units. The air handling unit will then operate as a constant volume unit, but one
        having
        setpoints representative of its designated group of terminal units. The unit will then run according to a user
        definable
        time schedule in the following modes</p><br><br>Occupied Mode: the unit will maintain<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A <input type=\'text\' id=\'occCoolingSetpoint\' default=\'74\'>degrees F space cooling setpoint</li>
        <li>A <input type=\'text\' id=\'occHeatingSetpoint\' default=\'70\'>degrees F space heating setpoint </li>
    </ul><br><br>Unoccupied Mode(night setback): The unit will maintain<br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>A <input type=\'text\'id=\'unOccCoolingSetpoint\'default=\'85\'>degrees F space cooling setpint</li>
        <li>A <input type=\'text\'id=\'unOccHeatingSetpoint\'default=\'55\'>degrees F space heating setpoint</li>
    </ul><br><br><strong>Unit Optimal Start:</strong><br>The unit will use an optimal start algorithm for morning start
    up.
    This algorithm will minimize the unoocupied warm up or cool down period while still achieving comfort conditions of
    scheduled occupied period.<br><br><strong>Alarms will be provided as follows</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li>High Space Temp: If the zone temperature is greater than the cooling sepoint by a user definable amount.
        </li>
        <li>Low Space Temp: If the zone temperature is less that the heating setpoint by a user definable amount.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <strong>Power up start Delay:</strong><br>There will be a 60 second delay in enabling the equipment on
    intial start up or after a power loss.<br><br><strong>Demand Limiting - Setpoint Optimization:</strong><br>To lower
    power consumption, the cooling and heating setpoints will automatically relax(offset up when cooling and down when
    heating) when the facility power consumption exceeds definable thresholds. The amount of relaxation will be user
    configurable. The setpoints will automatically return to their previous settings when the facility power consumption
    drops below the thresholds.<br><br><strong>Rnet wireless Gateway</strong>:<br>The Rnet Wireless Gateway is designed
    for
    use within the building interior. The wireless signals can pass through a drop ceiling and up to two walls made of
    gypsum and steel studs with minimal degradation.<br><br>
