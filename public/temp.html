<strong>RunConditions</strong>
<p>The Unit will supply conditioned air to its designated terminal units and operate as a variable air volume unit.  The unit will run according to the folling user selectable modes:</p>
<ul class='list-group'>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        Off
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        Continuously
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        via BAS Command
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        as Locally Scheduled
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        via Linked Scheduled
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>Off Mode:</strong>
<p>The unit will not run and all dampers, valves and fans will remain in their off position</p>
<strong>Continuously</strong>
<p>The unit will run continuously in the occupied mode.</p>
<strong>via BAS Command</strong>
<p>The unit will be enabled and disabled via a Bacnet Binary command, either from a remote source, or locally through the software interface. once enabled, the unit will run continuously in the occupied mode.</p>
<strong>as Locally Scheduled</strong>
<p>The air handling unit will operate as a variable volume unit, but one having setpoints that represent those of a single zone unit.  The unit will then run according to a user definable time schedule in the following modes:</p>
<ul class='list-group'>Occupied Mode: The unit will maintain:
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        A <input id='spaceCoolingSetpointOcc' type='number'> degrees F space cooling setpoint
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        A <input id='spaceHeatingSetpointOc' type='number'> degrees F space heating setpoint
    </li>
</ul>
<ul class='list-group'>Unoccupied Mode: The unit will maintain:
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        A <input id='spaceCoolingSetpointUnocc' type='number'> degrees F space cooling setpoint
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        A <input id='spaceHeatingSetpointUnocc' type='number'> degrees F space heating setpoint
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>Unit Optimal Start</strong>
<p>The unit will use an optimal start algorithm for morning start-up.  This alogorithm will minimize the unoccupied warm up or cool down period while still achieving comfort conditions by the start of scheduled occupied period.</p>
<p>Alarms will be provided as follows:</p>
<ul class='list-group'>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        High Space Temp: If the zone temperature is greater than the cooling setpoint by a user definable amount.
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        Low Space Temp:  if the zone temperature is less than the heating setpoint by a user definable amount.
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>via linked Schedule</strong>
<p>The air handling unit will exchange information with the terminal units as follows:</p>
<ul class='list-group'>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        Calculated information sent from the air handling unit to the terminal units:
        <ul class='list-group'>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                Current Mode of operation
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                current static pressure
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                current supply air temperature
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
               current outside air temperature
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='list-group-item'>
        Calculated information representative of all terminal units sent from the terminal units to the air handling unit:
        <ul class='list-group'>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                Space Temperature
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                Setpoints, both occupied and unoccupied
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                maximum damper position
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
               indoor air quality (if present)
            </li>
            <li class='list-group-item'>
                space relative humidity (if present)
             </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<strong>Power-up Start-up Delay</strong>
<p>There will be a 60 second delay in enabling the equipment on intial start up or after a power loss.</p>
<strong>Demand limiting - Setpoint Optimization</strong>
<p>To lower power consumption, the cooling and heating setpoints will automatically relax (offset up when cooling and down when heating) when the facility power consumption exceeds definable thresholds.  the amount of relaxation will be user configurable.  The setpoints will automatically return to their previous settings when the facility power consumption drops below the thresholds.</p>
